00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,980
Pupil's Book, Unit 2, pages 26 and 27.

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,099
Sarah's Favourite Game

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,460
I'm Pablo.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,780
I live with my mum, dad, grandma and grandpa.

5
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,859
Today, my cousin Sarah is here too.

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:30,100
Sarah's got black hair and brown eyes.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,879
Sarah's favourite game is Hide and Seek.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,859
I close my eyes and I count to ten and Sarah hides.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,320
Today, she's hiding in the cupboard in the kitchen.

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,519
She's in the cupboard in the kitchen, again.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,320
She always hides.

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,400
Oh, she isn't there.

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,219
Sarah, I say, where are you?

14
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,159
Is she next to the bookcase?

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,320
No, she isn't.

16
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:19,379
Sarah, I say, where are you?

17
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,959
Is she in the garden?

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,560
No, she isn't.

19
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:34,179
Sarah, I say, where are you?

20
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,459
Mum, dad, grandma and grandpa come to help.

21
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,840
But we can't find Sarah anywhere.

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Then, grandma sees Sarah's crayons on the table.

23
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,219
Is she under the table?

24
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,800
She says.

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,760
Yes, says mum.

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,900
She is.

27
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,340
Hello, Sarah.

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,020
Sarah, I say.

29
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,020
Bye-bye.
