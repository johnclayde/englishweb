How Cows Got Their Spots

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,440
Cathy is a young white cow.

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:23,059
She lives with her mum on a big farm.

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,480
There are horses, sheep and chickens.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,759
There are also lots of flies.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,100
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Go away!

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,859
Use your tail, says her mum.

9
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:54,859
But Cathy's tail is very short and the flies are not scared of her.

10
00:00:54,859 --> 00:01:01,840
One day she tells a friend about her problem.

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:10,859
Follow me, says Little Horse and he jumps into some black mud.

12
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:16,159
Come on! Jump in! He shouts.

13
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:26,120
When Cathy stands up, her beautiful white coat is very dirty.

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,900
Look, the young cows laugh.

15
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,800
Cathy's got big black spots.

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,960
Suddenly, lots of flies come from behind the house.

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,200
Run, says Cathy's mum.

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,760
Hide! Shout the young cows.

19
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:01,879
When the flies go, lots of the young cows have bites.

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,960
Ouch! They cry.

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,340
Ouch!

22
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,759
I haven't got any bites, laughs Cathy.

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,680
Thank you, Little Horse.

24
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,460
Now lots of white cows have black spots,

25
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,120
so flies don't bite them.

26
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,219
What?!

27
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,120
What?

28
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,580
I'll see you, Little Horse,

29
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,180
I'll see you, Little Horse.

30
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,000
Childish.

31
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,460
I'll see you later.

32
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:32,939
Come on.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,300
Let me see you later.

34
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,180
I'll see you later on.

35
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,620
Bye-bye.

36
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:51,960
Bye-bye.

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,480
This is a mystery.

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,800
I'll see you later on.
