00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,080
Knock, knock!

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,920
It's Lucy at the door.

5
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,019
Hello, Lucy.

6
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:23,600
Hello, Max.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,100
Lucy and Max are friends.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,280
Today is the first day of school.

9
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,700
It's time to pack your bag.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,820
My bag.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,259
It's in the cupboard.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,980
Where's my pencil?

13
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,079
It's under the chair.

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,159
Oh, yes.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,660
Take a pencil to school.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,780
That's the rule.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,240
Where's my pen?

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,020
It's on the table.

19
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:12,479
Oh, yes.

20
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,579
Take a pen to school.

21
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,719
That's the rule.

22
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,459
And where's my ruler?

23
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,500
It's next to your pen.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,620
Oh, yes.

25
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,599
Take a ruler to school.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,700
That's the rule.

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,740
Where are my books?

28
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,520
They're on the bookcase.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,720
Oh, yes.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,720
Take your books to school.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,820
That's the rule.

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,460
And my crayons?

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,220
What are these?

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,840
The crayons are on the floor,

35
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,080
under the window.

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,880
Hurry up.

37
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,340
It's time to go.

38
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,340
Don't be late for school.

39
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,140
That's the number one rule.
