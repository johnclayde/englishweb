Making a bookcase

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:14,220
Listen to the tape then answer this question.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,840
What is Susan's favourite colour?

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,730
You're working hard, George.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,900
What are you doing?

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,580
I'm making a bookcase.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,110
Give me that hammer please, Dan.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,090
Which hammer?

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,230
This one?

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,200
No, not that one.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,750
The big one.

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,830
Here you are.

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,820
Thanks, Dan.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,180
What are you going to do now, George?

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,760
I'm going to paint it.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,240
What colour are you going to paint it?

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,250
I'm going to paint it pink.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,940
Pink!

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,020
This bookcase isn't for me.

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,650
It's for my daughter, Susan.

22
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,650
Pink's her favourite colour.
