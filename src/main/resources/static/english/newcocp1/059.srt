Lesson 59

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Is that all?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,740
Listen to the tape then answer this question.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,610
Does the lady buy any chalk?

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,390
I want some envelopes, please.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,550
Do you want the large size or the small size?

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,260
The large size, please.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,600
Do you have any writing paper?

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,440
Yes, we do.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,090
I don't have any small pads.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,430
I only have large ones.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,000
Do you want a pad?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,980
Yes, please.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,660
And I want some glue.

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,120
A bottle of glue.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,650
And I want a large box of chalk, too.

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,380
I only have small boxes.

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,220
Do you want one?

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,150
No, thank you.

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,660
Is that all?

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,830
That's all, thank you.

22
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,390
What else do you want?

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,390
I want my change.
