Lesson 45

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,950
The boss's letter

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:13,050
Listen to the tape then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,790
Why can't Pamela type the letter?

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,250
Can you come here a minute please, Bob?

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,260
Yes, sir?

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,850
Where's Pamela?

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,470
She's next door.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,140
She's in her office, sir.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,200
Can she type this letter for me?

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,460
Ask her please.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,350
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,000
Can you type this letter for the boss please, Pamela?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,670
Yes, of course I can.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,630
Here you are.

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,630
Thank you, Bob.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,730
Bob!

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,940
Yes?

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,320
What's the matter?

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,620
I can't type this letter.

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,190
I can't read it!

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,190
The boss's handwriting is terrible!
