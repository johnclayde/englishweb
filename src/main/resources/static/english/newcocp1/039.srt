Lesson 39

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,930
Don't drop it!

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:13,310
Listen to the tape then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:19,670
Where does Sam put the vase in the end?

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,990
What are you going to do with that vase, Penny?

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,470
I'm going to put it on this table, Sam.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,510
Don't do that.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,560
Give it to me.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,880
What are you going to do with it?

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,370
I'm going to put it here, in front of the window.

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,880
Be careful!

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't drop it!

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,380
Don't put it there, Sam.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,710
Put it here, on this shelf.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,560
There we are!

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,090
It's a lovely vase.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,090
Those flowers are lovely, too.
