00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,130
Lesson 43

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,100
Hurry up!

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,140
Listen to the tape then answer this question.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:18,270
How do you know Sam doesn't make the tea very often?

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,100
Can you make the tea, Sam?

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,950
Yes, of course I can, Penny.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,150
Is there any water in this kettle?

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,770
Yes, there is.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,490
Where's the tea?

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,040
It's over there,

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,310
behind the teapot.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,590
Can you see it?

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,110
I can see the teapot,

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,320
but I can't see the tea.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,340
There it is!

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,710
It's in front of you!

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,120
Ah yes, I can see it now.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,300
Where are the cups?

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,220
There are some in the cupboard.

20
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,690
Can you find them?

21
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,430
Yes. Here they are.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,370
Hurry up, Sam!

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,370
The kettle's boiling!
