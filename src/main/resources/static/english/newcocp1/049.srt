00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,050
Lesson 49

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,960
At the butcher's

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,240
Listen to the tape then answer this question.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,190
What does Mr. Bird like?

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,580
Do you want any meat today. Mrs. Bird?

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,370
Yes, please.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,160
Do you want beef or lamb?

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,680
Beef, please.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,620
This lamb's very good.

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,830
I like lamb, but my husband doesn't.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,140
What about some steak?

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,530
This is a nice piece.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,850
Give me that piece, please.

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,010
And a pound of mince, too.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,120
Do you want a chicken, Mrs. Bird?

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,270
They're very nice.

17
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,540
No, thank you.

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,200
My husband likes steak,

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,540
but he doesn't like chicken.

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,090
To tell you the truth, Mrs. Bird,

21
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,090
I don't like chicken either!
